# SmolLM2-135M Burn CPU Inference Implementation - IN PROGRESS ⚠️

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS: SafeTensors Downloaded, Real Inference NOT Yet Implemented

**Goal**: Complete real Burn-based CPU inference using SmolLM2-135M model with actual text generation.

## Phase 1: Model & Dependencies Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ SafeTensors Model Downloaded: 257MB `model.safetensors` ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] ✅ Tokenizer Downloaded: 2MB `tokenizer.json` ✅ VERIFIED 
- [x] ✅ Config Downloaded: 4KB `config.json` ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] ✅ Location: `./models/smollm2-135m/` ✅ VERIFIED IN PROJECT ROOT
- [x] ✅ Burn framework integration with CPU backend (NdArray) ✅ WORKING
- [x] ✅ Real tokenizer from Hugging Face (direct HTTP download) ✅ WORKING

## Phase 2: Basic Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] ✅ SafeTensors file verification and path storage ✅ WORKING
- [x] ✅ Real tokenization using `tokenizers` crate ✅ WORKING
- [x] ✅ Basic Burn tensor operations: mean, sum, variance ✅ WORKING
- [x] ✅ cargo lint passes ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] ✅ cargo machete clean (no unused dependencies) ✅ VERIFIED

## Phase 3: Inference Implementation ❌ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Llama model architecture implementation in Burn
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: SafeTensors weight loading into Burn model
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Model forward pass through transformer layers
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Autoregressive text generation loop
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Real prompt processing and text generation
- [ ] ❌ **CURRENT**: Only doing tokenization + basic tensor stats (not real inference)

## Phase 4: Real Text Generation Testing ❌ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Test real text generation with loaded model weights
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Autoregressive generation: "Hello" → "Hello world, how are you?"
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Math reasoning: "What is 2+2?" → actual LLM response using model
- [ ] ❌ **CURRENT**: Only hardcoded responses based on token statistics

## REMAINING WORK TO COMPLETE CPU INFERENCE DEMO

### Critical Missing Components:
1. **Llama Model Architecture in Burn** 
   - Need to implement Llama transformer layers (30 layers for SmolLM2-135M)
   - Attention mechanism, feed-forward networks, RMSNorm
   - Rotary positional encoding (RoPE)

2. **SafeTensors Weight Loading**
   - Load 257MB `model.safetensors` into Burn model
   - Map HuggingFace weight names to Burn model parameters
   - Handle weight format conversions (bfloat16 → f32)

3. **Text Generation Pipeline**
   - Implement autoregressive generation loop
   - Add temperature/sampling controls
   - Implement proper stop token handling

### Success Criteria ❌ INCOMPLETE
- [x] ✅ `cargo lint` ✅ PASSES
- [x] ✅ SafeTensors files downloaded (257MB model + tokenizer + config) ✅ VERIFIED
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Real model forward pass through 30 transformer layers
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Text generation: "Hello" → actual continuation from model
- [ ] ❌ **MISSING**: Uses loaded SafeTensors weights for predictions

## Current Implementation Status
- **SafeTensors Model**: `./models/smollm2-135m/model.safetensors` (257MB) ✅ EXISTS
- **Tokenizer**: `./models/smollm2-135m/tokenizer.json` (2MB) ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
- **Config**: `./models/smollm2-135m/config.json` (4KB) ✅ VERIFIED
- **Real Tokenization**: "Hello" → token ID 19556 ✅ WORKING
- **Burn Tensor Ops**: Basic operations (mean, variance) ✅ WORKING
- **Linting**: cargo lint passes ✅ VERIFIED

## Current Testing Commands
```bash
# ✅ PASSES - Basic infrastructure works
cargo lint
cargo test --features burn-cpu test_hello_world_engine_creation

# ❌ NOT REAL INFERENCE - Only tokenization + hardcoded responses
cargo test --features burn-cpu -- --ignored test_safetensors_inference
```

## Current Test Output (NOT Real Inference)
```
Testing SmolLM2-135M SafeTensors inference...
SafeTensors Hello response: 'Hello! SmolLM2-135M SafeTensors analysis: 1 tokens, mean=19556.0, var=0.00'
SafeTensors math response: '4'  # ← HARDCODED, not from model predictions
```

**CURRENT STATUS**: ⚠️ **Infrastructure Ready - Real Inference NOT Implemented**

## Next Steps to Complete Demo:
1. Study Burn Llama implementation from tracel-ai/models
2. Implement SmolLM2-135M Llama architecture in Burn
3. Load SafeTensors weights into model  
4. Replace hardcoded responses with real autoregressive generation
5. Test: "Hello" should generate actual model continuation, not hardcoded stats
