# The State of the Art in Serving Large Language Models

Serving **large language models (LLMs)** efficiently is not just about running a model faster ‚Äî it requires solving two intertwined challenges:

1. **Hardware optimization**: Maximizing GPU performance with low-level kernel tuning, quantization, and memory-efficient execution.
2. **Batch optimization**: Handling many concurrent user requests with minimal overhead, especially when prompts and output lengths vary.

Today, the two strongest approaches are **TensorRT-LLM** and **vLLM**. Each solves part of the problem, but no single **open-source solution** yet achieves both goals seamlessly.

## üîπ TensorRT-LLM: Hardware-Tuned Inference

TensorRT-LLM is NVIDIA‚Äôs extension of TensorRT for large-scale transformer models. It focuses on **maximizing raw performance per model** through:

* **Fused CUDA kernels** (FlashAttention, optimized GEMM, etc.).
* **Quantization support** (FP16, BF16, INT8, FP8).
* **Multi-GPU scaling** via tensor and pipeline parallelism.
* **Efficient KV-cache management** for low-latency token generation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** TensorRT-LLM is **not fully open source**. The core runtime and optimized GPU kernels are proprietary. Only parsers, plugins, and sample code are open.

TensorRT-LLM delivers **industry-leading throughput and latency** for giant models, but it is **not a serving runtime**. Concurrency and batching must be managed externally, typically via **Triton Inference Server**.

## üîπ vLLM: Concurrency-Tuned Serving

vLLM is an **open-source runtime** designed specifically for LLM APIs. Its key innovation, **PagedAttention**, treats the KV-cache like virtual memory:

* Splits cache into **pages** for efficient reuse across requests.
* Dynamically manages memory for **variable-length sequences**.
* Enables **token-level batching**, merging tokens from multiple users into a single GPU pass.

vLLM excels at **high-concurrency workloads**, such as serving chatbots to thousands of users. It integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face models and is trivial to deploy.

However, vLLM‚Äôs optimizations are **runtime-focused**, not hardware-level. It does not match TensorRT-LLM in raw GPU throughput or multi-GPU scaling.

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Gap: No Turnkey Open-Source Solution

The ecosystem today shows a clear gap:

* **TensorRT-LLM**: Hardware-level optimization, proprietary core, requires complex serving infrastructure.
* **vLLM**: Open-source, high-concurrency runtime, but lacks GPU-level kernel optimization.

There is **currently no turnkey, fully open-source solution** that combines:

1. TensorRT-LLM‚Äôs **hardware-optimized execution**, and
2. vLLM‚Äôs **dynamic, high-concurrency scheduling**.

---

## üöÄ Outlook

The state of the art is a **split solution**:

* Enterprises seeking maximum efficiency adopt **TensorRT-LLM + Triton**.
* Developers and researchers favor **vLLM** for ease of use and high concurrency.

A future serving stack could unify these worlds: **hardware-optimized like TensorRT-LLM**, **serving-optimized like vLLM**, and importantly, **fully open source**. Until then, deploying LLMs at scale involves tradeoffs between raw GPU efficiency and flexible multi-user serving.
