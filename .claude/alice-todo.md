# Alice: SWIM Protocol Consensus Experiment - TODO List

## Project Status: **ACTIVE**

### Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] **Research**: Read parallel development documentation and understand current consensus implementation
- [x] **Research**: Study SWIM protocol and foca library implementation details
- [x] **Setup**: Create Alice project directory structure and documentation

### Current Task ðŸ”„
- [ ] **Analysis**: Use /engineer to evaluate current consensus scheme comprehensively

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

#### Phase 1: Current System Analysis
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure consensus resolution times for different peer counts
- [ ] **Memory Analysis**: Profile memory usage during consensus operations
- [ ] **Network Overhead**: Analyze bandwidth requirements of current protocol
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Test behavior with network partitions, failures, conflicts

#### Phase 2: SWIM Prototype Development  
- [ ] **Library Evaluation**: Study foca library API and integration patterns
- [ ] **Prototype Implementation**: Create SWIM-based consensus module (study only)
- [ ] **Data Structure Mapping**: Adapt NodeInfo/PeerInfo for SWIM protocol
- [ ] **Feature Preservation**: Maintain AI-specific features (metrics, node types)

#### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
- [ ] **Performance Comparison**: Benchmark SWIM vs current implementation
- [ ] **Correctness Validation**: Test conflict resolution and consistency
- [ ] **Scalability Testing**: Evaluate behavior with 10, 50, 100+ peers
- [ ] **Integration Assessment**: Estimate implementation effort and risks

#### Phase 4: Decision Framework
- [ ] **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare implementation effort vs performance gains
- [ ] **Risk Documentation**: Identify migration challenges and mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Final Recommendation**: Data-driven decision on consensus strategy
- [ ] **Implementation Roadmap**: If proceeding, create detailed migration plan

### Infrastructure Tasks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete current-analysis.md with /engineer findings
- [ ] **Testing Setup**: Create benchmark harness for performance comparisons
- [ ] **Git Management**: Commit all research and analysis work locally
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Structure prototype code for easy comparison

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Approach**: Comprehensive evaluation before implementation
2. **Scope**: Focus on consensus algorithms, not full service discovery replacement
3. **Method**: Study existing libraries without introducing external dependencies
4. **Timeline**: 4-week experiment with clear success criteria

## Next Steps
1. Engage /engineer to analyze current consensus implementation
2. Document findings in current-analysis.md
3. Begin performance benchmarking of existing system
4. Continue with SWIM prototype development

## Success Metrics
- Detailed technical analysis comparing both approaches
- Quantitative performance data for informed decision-making
- Clear recommendation with implementation roadmap
- All work committed locally as requested
