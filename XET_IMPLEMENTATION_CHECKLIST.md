# Xet Integration Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Dependencies and Setup

- [ ] Add `xet-core` dependency to `crates/inference/Cargo.toml`
- [ ] Research xet-core API and usage patterns
- [ ] Create feature flag for xet integration (optional, for conditional compilation)
- [ ] Update root `Cargo.toml` if needed for workspace dependencies

## Phase 2: Command Interface

- [ ] Extend download subcommand with `--use-xet` flag in CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Update help text and documentation for the new flag
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility - default behavior unchanged
- [ ] Add validation for xet-specific parameters if any

## Phase 3: Core Implementation

- [ ] Create new module `xet_downloader.rs` in inference crate
- [ ] Implement `XetDownloader` struct with download functionality
- [ ] Add error handling specific to xet operations
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for xet downloads
- [ ] Add timeout and retry logic for robustness
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for download methods (trait-based approach)

## Phase 4: Integration

- [ ] Modify existing download logic to support multiple backends
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanism (xet -> git lfs if xet fails)
- [ ] Update model discovery and metadata handling for xet
- [ ] Ensure file integrity verification works with both methods
- [ ] Handle authentication if required by xet

## Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for `XetDownloader`
- [ ] Create integration tests comparing xet vs git lfs downloads
- [ ] Add tests for fallback behavior
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Test with various model sizes and types

## Phase 6: Quality Assurance

- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with `cargo test`
- [ ] Check test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] Run any existing CI/CD checks locally

## Phase 7: Documentation

- [ ] Update inline code documentation
- [ ] Update CLI help text and man pages if applicable
- [ ] Add examples of using `--use-xet` flag
- [ ] Document performance differences and when to use each method

## Phase 8: Validation

- [ ] Test with real Hugging Face models
- [ ] Verify download integrity with both methods
- [ ] Performance comparison testing
- [ ] Test on different platforms (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code passes linting (clippy) with no warnings
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (rustfmt)
- [ ] Feature works as specified in rationale document
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code review completed (when ready)

## Notes

- Start with a minimal viable implementation focusing on core functionality
- Prioritize error handling and user experience
- Consider logging/telemetry for debugging download issues
- Keep performance metrics to help users choose the best method
