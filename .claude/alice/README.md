# Alice: SWIM Protocol Consensus Experiment

## Overview

Alice is a research project to evaluate replacing Inferno's current consensus implementation with the SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership) protocol. This experiment focuses on consensus algorithms for sharing node operational data in distributed systems.

## Current State Analysis

The existing Inferno service discovery system implements a custom consensus algorithm with:

### Strengths of Current Implementation
- **AI-Specific Design**: Purpose-built for inference workloads with metrics-based health checking
- **Majority Rule Consensus**: Simple majority-based conflict resolution with timestamp tie-breaking  
- **Self-Sovereign Updates**: Only nodes can update their own information
- **Performance Optimized**: < 5ms consensus for 10 peers, lock-free reads
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external services required
- **Well Tested**: 89 tests with comprehensive coverage

### Current Architecture
- **Consensus Module**: `/crates/shared/src/service_discovery/consensus.rs`
- **Algorithm**: Majority rule with timestamp tie-breaking for conflicts
- **Performance**: O(n*m log m) complexity, optimized for < 100 peers
- **Features**: Conflict detection, consistency validation, detailed metrics

## SWIM Protocol Research

### Key Findings
- **Multiple Rust Implementations**: swim-rs (marvinlanhenke), foca (caio), chitchat (quickwit)
- **Protocol Benefits**: Scalable failure detection, gossip-based dissemination, low network overhead
- **Design Philosophy**: Separates failure detection from membership update dissemination

### Foca Library Analysis
- **Minimal Core**: Transport and identity agnostic design
- **Flexibility**: Custom member identification and message encoding
- **Constraints**: Requires heap allocations, no heavy OS dependencies
- **API**: Minimal, focuses on protocol mechanics over service discovery features

## Experiment Goals

1. **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate SWIM vs current consensus for AI inference clusters
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure consensus resolution times and network overhead
3. **Integration Assessment**: Determine effort required to integrate SWIM-based consensus
4. **Feature Parity**: Assess ability to maintain AI-specific features (metrics-based health, node types)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current System Evaluation
- [ ] Use /engineer to perform comprehensive analysis of existing consensus
- [ ] Benchmark current performance characteristics
- [ ] Identify specific strengths and limitations

### Phase 2: SWIM Prototype Development
- [ ] Implement SWIM-based consensus using foca library (study only, no external deps)
- [ ] Adapt SWIM for service discovery use case
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing NodeInfo/PeerInfo structures

### Phase 3: Comparative Testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: consensus resolution time, memory usage, network overhead
- [ ] Correctness validation: conflict resolution, consistency guarantees
- [ ] Scalability testing: behavior with different peer counts (10, 50, 100 nodes)

### Phase 4: Decision Framework
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis: implementation effort vs performance gains
- [ ] Risk assessment: API stability, maintenance burden, operational complexity
- [ ] Recommendation: Continue with custom implementation or migrate to SWIM

## Technical Considerations

### Current Implementation Advantages
- **Domain-Specific**: Tailored for AI inference node operational data
- **Proven**: 65% complete, battle-tested in production scenarios
- **Simple**: Easy to understand, debug, and maintain
- **Fast**: Sub-microsecond backend access, optimized data structures

### SWIM Potential Benefits  
- **Industry Standard**: Well-established protocol with formal analysis
- **Scalability**: Better performance with large peer counts (100+ nodes)
- **Failure Detection**: More sophisticated failure detection mechanisms
- **Network Efficiency**: Gossip-based dissemination reduces bandwidth

### Integration Challenges
- **External Dependencies**: Would require foca or similar library
- **API Changes**: Different abstractions from current consensus system
- **Feature Mapping**: Translating AI-specific features to generic membership protocol
- **Testing Overhead**: New protocol requires extensive validation

## Success Criteria

The experiment will be considered successful if it produces:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed comparison of current vs SWIM approaches
2. **Performance Data**: Quantitative measurements of both systems
3. **Implementation Roadmap**: Clear path forward with effort estimates
4. **Risk Assessment**: Thorough evaluation of migration challenges
5. **Clear Recommendation**: Data-driven decision on consensus strategy
