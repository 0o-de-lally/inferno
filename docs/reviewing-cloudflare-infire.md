- **Cold start optimization** - Minimize time from model request to first inference
  - Model download from storage
  - GPU memory loading
  - Kernel graph generation and compilation
  - First token latency minimization

**Scale & Economics**
- **Massive multi-tenancy** - Serving thousands of customers on shared infrastructure
- **Cost per inference optimization** - Every millisecond and GPU cycle matters at scale
- **Hardware utilization maximization** - >90% GPU utilization targets
